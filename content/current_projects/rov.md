This semester I joined the Purdue ROV team. This student-led team builds an underwater robot that performs tasks to protect the ocean's ecosystem. These tasks are stuipulated by the MATE ROV competition, a yearly World Championship that we take part in over the summer. 

This year, the competition is in Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada and to go with the theme with the location, our robot should be able to handle low temperatures in an ice tank, high water velocities in a flume tank, and saltwater in an offshore engineering basin. 

#### Project Introduction
I am a part of the Mechanical team and am working on the electronics enclosure of the vehicle. This includes a carrier plate and a lid, that together, should be waterproof and handle water pressure at approximately 7.5 meters deep. 

The lid prevents electronics from contacting water and has all the team members names embossed onto it. 

The plate has scaffolding to hold the electronic stack and holes for binders.

#### Carrier Plate 
The carrier plate will be Anodized Aluminum with through holes to screw the lid onto it. It also has a slot for an o-ring. 

#### Enclosure Lid 
The lid will be resin printed out of Formlabs Clear Resin V5. This year, we decided to switch the material from Aluminum (like the plate), and so I have been spending most of my time working on this. This change was made because it will make it more lightweight, aesthetic and make it easier to monitor leaks. 

Previous years also had the enclosure in a more box-like shape, but now I am still experimenting with different shapes to make it more hydrodyanmic for the rougher conditions.
