I am currently enrolld in ME 264, Sophomore Design at Purdue. With a teammate, we have been tasked with creating a desk organizer. This product must be made with given material constraints, and should be be able to hold some other objects that we have created in the class.

Some examples of these objects are a machined hammer, CNC Nameplate, and a soldered clock.
