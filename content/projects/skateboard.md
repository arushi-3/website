In the Summer of 2025, during my internship at ATI motors, I built a prototype of an intelligent fork for pallet transportation. "Skateboard" is a nickname given to the project.

The skateboardâ€™s key advantage over pallet movers and similar machines is its ability to move omnidirectionally and perform zero-radius turns. This increases positional accuracy and could potentially save time and space. It would also use an electronic differential rather than a mechanical one, which is more compact and precise. 

For this project, I used Onshape for CAD work, SimScale for FEA analysis, and the Arduino IDE for hardware tasks. Most of the parts were either 3D print, laser cut, or machined. 

Before I began, some components like the motors, encoders, pulleys, and microcontrollers had already been selected. I was also given the following the design constraints- 
1. Test the motor before beginning designing and assembly
2. Make the unit as compact as possible 
3. Use 80 mm diameter wheels 

To fit the existing setup, I designed my own GT2 pulleys, and other parts for the electronic differential unit.

Through this process, I learnt how to CAD sheet metal parts, and got many of my designs laser cut and welded.
