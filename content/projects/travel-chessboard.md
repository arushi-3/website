In high school, for my Design and Technology AS Level coursework project, I ideated, designed and built a travel chessboard out of wood, metal, clay and magnets.

I interviewed five different people from age groups ranging from pre-teen to adult, and I chose my brother, Advay's challenge, who had been struggling with playing chess on the school bus. 

He needed an efficient way to story chess pieces when they were not on the chessboard. 

Some features of my design were- 
 1. The user can store their pieces in two different places 
 2. Smoother gampeplay because the design relies on magnets
 3. The board folds in half so it fits easily in a school bag

I built three different prototypes to validate my ideas.

I modified many components through the prototyping process, including the storage system and the size, to take into account user needs and feedback. Then, I created CAD sketches of the design, a production plan, and estimated the amount of time it would take to build the final product.
