    <h1>Travel Chessboard</h1>

    

    <p>In high school, for my Design and Technology AS Level coursework project, I ideated, designed and built a travel chessboard out of wood, metal, clay and magnets.</p>

<p>I interview five different people from age groups ranging from pre-teen to adult, and I chose my brother, Advay, who had been struggling with playing chess on the school bus.</p>
<p>He needed an efficient way to story chess pieces when they were not on the chessboard.</p>
<p>Some features of my design were-</p>
<ol>
<li>The user can store their pieces in two different places</li>
<li>Smoother gampeplay because the design relies on magnets</li>
<li>The board folds in half so it fits easily in a school bag</li>
</ol>
<p>I built three different prototypes to validate my ideas.</p>
