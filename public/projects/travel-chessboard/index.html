    <h1>Travel Chessboard</h1>

    

    <p>In high school, for my Design and Technology AS Level coursework project, I ideated, designed and built a travel chessboard out of wood, metal, clay and magnets.</p>

<p>To choose my user, I interviewed five different people from age groups ranging from pre-teen to adult. In the end, I chose my brother, Advay, who had been struggling with playing chess on the school bus.</p>
<p>He needed an efficient way to story chess pieces when they were not on the chessboard.</p>
<p>Some features of my design were-</p>
<ol>
<li>The user can store their pieces in two different places</li>
<li>Smoother gampeplay because the design relies on magnets</li>
<li>The board folds in half so it fits easily in a school bag</li>
</ol>
<p>I built three different prototypes to validate my ideas.</p>

<p>I modified many components through the prototyping process, including the storage system and the size, to take into account user needs and feedback. Then, I created CAD sketches of the design, a production plan, and estimated the amount of time it would take to build the final product.</p>

<p>The general manufacturing process I followed was:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cutting the pieces

</li>
<li>
<p>Making permanent joinery</p>
<ul>
<li>Like dovetail joints at the corners

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Counter-sinking the base</p>
<ul>
<li>For the hinges</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Painting and varnishing the pieces</p>
<ul>
<li>A layer of white followed by a layer of dark brown</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding the hinges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assembling the base and sides</p>
<ul>
<li>With super glue and other fastening methods

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making and adding finish to the base of the board

</li>
<li>
<p>Painting and varnishing the chess pieces</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The final product-

<p>Finally, I tested and evaluated the product in its intended environment.
