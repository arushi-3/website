    <h1>Purdue EPICS - Shape-Sorter (Mailbox) Game</h1>

    

    <p>As a part of Purdue EPICS, a service-learning engineering projection, my team and I built a shape-sorting game for the riders at Agape therapeutic riding.</p>

<p>We were inspired by the childhood shape-sorter game that helps develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination.</p>

<p>Agape serves individuals and groups of all ages who have physical, emotional, cognitive, or social disabilities through various equine-assisted programs and we wanted to design and build a game/incentive for their younger riders.</p>
<p>We named it &ldquo;mailbox&rdquo;, because our initial CAD resembled one. Each unit would be a different color and the game pieces would also be painted to match the color of their respective boxes.</p>

<p>After working on the preliminary design and CAD, we moved to the prototyping phase. For our prototype, we built a box with holes in the front piece, and a door on the side to be able to take out the pieces.</p>

<p>We got feedback from experts in the field, and adjusted the design to make the front panel removable. This would allow us to provide our community partner with new panel designs over the years, and make it easier for the user to take the pieces out. We made another prototype to reflect these new ideas. The panels would be laser cut on acrylic.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, I started to work on the CAD designs for the pegs and 3D printed prototypes of them.</p>

<p>When we received the PLA printed parts, we quickly realized that they were not strong enough to handle drops from high heights, and it would take a lot of time and filament to manufacture 30 pieces. So, after a few decision matrixes and conversations, we decided to use the CNC wood mill to make the pieces.</p>

<p>We ordered all the materials, and started construction of 5 mailboxes. We used the table saw to cut the long wood into size, router for the channels, the drill press, drill gun for holes and impact driver for fastening.</p>

<p>We first painted the pieces white and then applied their final colors.</p>

<p>Once we put everything together, we were able to deliver the project at the community partner&rsquo;s site.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m no longer a part of Purdue EPICS, this project, which spanned my freshman year in college, taught me a lot about research, collaboration, and community service. And as design lead, I enjoyed leading the design process by ensuring the team stays aligned with project timelines and design goals.</p>
