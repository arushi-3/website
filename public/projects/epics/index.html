    <h1>Mailbox Matching Game - Purdue EPICS</h1>

    

    <p>As a part of Purdue EPICS, a service-led engineering projection, my team and I built a mailbox matching game for the riders at Agape therapeutic riding.</p>

<p>We were inspired by the childhood shape-sorter game, that helps develop motor skills and hand-eye coordination.</p>

<p>Agape serves individuals and groups of all ages who have physical, emotional, cognitive, or social disabilities through various equine-assisted programs and we wanted to design and build a game/incentive for their younger riders.</p>
<p>We named it &ldquo;mailbox&rdquo;, because our initial CAD resembled one. Each unit would be a different color and the game pieces would also be painted to match the color of their respective boxes.</p>

<p>After working on the preliminary design and CAD, we moved to the prototyping phase. For our prototype, we built a box with holes in the front piece, and a door on the side to be able to take out the pieces.</p>

<p>We got feedback from experts in the field, and changed the design a little more to to make the front panel removable. This would allow us to provide our community partner with new designs over the years, and make it easier for the user to take the pieces out. We made another prototype to reflect these new ideas. The panels would be laser cut on acrylic.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, I started to work on the CAD designs for the pegs, and 3D printed prototypes.</p>

<p>When we received the PLA printed parts, we quickly realized that they were not strong enough to handle drops from high heights, and it would take a lot of time and filament for all 30 pieces. So, after a few decision matrixes and conversations, I decided to use the CNC wood mill to make the pieces.</p>

<p>We ordered all the material, and started construction of 5 mailboxes. We used the table saw to cut the long wood into size, router for the channels, and the drill press to make holes.</p>

<p>We painted the pieces white, and then its actual color.</p>

<p>Once we put everything together, we were able to deliver the project at the community partner&rsquo;s site.</p>

<p>I am no longer a part of Purdue EPICS, but this project, which spanned my freshman year in college, taught me more about research, collaboration, and community service.</p>
