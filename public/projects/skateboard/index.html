   <meta name="description" content="Goal of the project
In the Summer of 2025, during my internship at ATI Motors, I built a prototype of an intelligent fork for pallet transportation. &ldquo;Skateboard&rdquo; is a nickname given to the project.

The skateboard’s key advantage over pallet movers and similar machines is its ability to move omnidirectionally and perform zero-radius turns. This increases positional accuracy and could potentially save time and space. It would also use an electronic differential rather than a mechanical one, which is more compact and precise.">

<p>In the Summer of 2025, during my internship at ATI Motors, I built a prototype of an intelligent fork for pallet transportation. &ldquo;Skateboard&rdquo; is a nickname given to the project.</p>

<p>The skateboard’s key advantage over pallet movers and similar machines is its ability to move omnidirectionally and perform zero-radius turns. This increases positional accuracy and could potentially save time and space. It would also use an electronic differential rather than a mechanical one, which is more compact and precise.</p>
<h5 id="design-process">Design Process</h5>
<p>For this project, I used Onshape for CAD work, SimScale for FEA analysis, and the Arduino IDE for hardware tasks. Most of the parts were either 3D printed, laser cut, or machined.</p>
<p>Before I began, some components like the motors, encoders, pulleys, and microcontrollers had already been selected by the company. To fit the given constraints, I designed my own GT2 pulleys and other parts for the electronic differential unit.</p>

<p>Through this process, I learned how to CAD sheet metal parts, and got many of my designs laser cut and welded.</p>
<h5 id="electronics-and-test-bench">Electronics and Test Bench</h5>
<p>After designing the complete assembly and sending parts to either get manufactured or 3D printed, I worked on the electronics.</p>

<p>The circuit consisted of a stack of an Arduino and two Motor Driver Shields that powered and controlled the 4 motors using data from Quadrature Encoders. I wrote a PID-based program, that monitored ticks and position of the wheels&rsquo; rotations.</p>
<p>Then, I started exploring different methods to communicate with the microcontroller system. My options were-</p>
<ol>
<li>Blynk (an IOT platform)</li>
<li>MQTT</li>
<li>Wi-Fi communication over a flask server</li>
</ol>
<p>I chose the third option and ran a webserver on my laptop to control the Arduino with an ESP32. To validate my code and set up, I created a test bench with the motors and all electronic components.</p>

<h5 id="assembly">Assembly</h5>
<p>I then moved on to assembling all the parts, which had been manufactured by this time. During this process, I realized that the foam board was too weak to hold the weight of the motors. So, I cut and drilled holes into a piece of scrap metal instead.</p>

<p>I faced some issues with the 3D printed parts breaking, but after some changes and reprinting, I was able to run it on the ground and test my code and other ideas.</p>

<p>With the design approved, I moved on to getting all the parts manufactured using metal. This meant modifying some of the designs for better manufacturability.</p>

<p>This was the outcome of three months of work at ATI Motors, and the company has mentioned plans to continue developing my work into an actual product. I truly enjoyed the learning process, and it was gratifying to see the final product come to life. I look forward to taking on more challenging and interesting projects like this!</p>
