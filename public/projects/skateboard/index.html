    <h1>Skateboard</h1>

    

    <p>In the Summer of 2025, during my internship at ATI motors, I built a prototype of an intelligent fork for pallet transportation. &ldquo;Skateboard&rdquo; is a nickname given to the project.</p>

<p>The skateboard’s key advantage over pallet movers and similar machines is its ability to move omnidirectionally and perform zero-radius turns. This increases positional accuracy and could potentially save time and space. It would also use an electronic differential rather than a mechanical one, which is more compact and precise.</p>
<p>For this project, I used Onshape for CAD work, SimScale for FEA analysis, and the Arduino IDE for hardware tasks. Most of the parts were either 3D print, laser cut, or machined.</p>
<p>Before I began, some components like the motors, encoders, pulleys, and microcontrollers had already been selected. I was also given the following the design constraints-</p>
<ol>
<li>Test the motor before beginning designing and assembly</li>
<li>Make the unit as compact as possible</li>
<li>Use 80 mm diameter wheels</li>
</ol>
<p>To fit the existing setup, I designed my own GT2 pulleys, and other parts for the electronic differential unit.</p>

<p>Through this process, I learnt how to CAD sheet metal parts, and got many of my designs laser cut and welded.</p>
