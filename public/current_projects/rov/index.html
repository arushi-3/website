    <h1>Purdue ROV (Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle)</h1>

    

    <p>This semester I joined the Purdue ROV team. This student-led team builds an underwater robot that performs tasks to protect the ocean&rsquo;s ecosystem. These tasks are stuipulated by the MATE ROV competition, a yearly World Championship that we take part in over the summer.</p>
<p>This year, the competition is in Newfoundland &amp; Labrador, Canada and to go with the theme of the location, our robot should be able to handle low temperatures in an ice tank, high water velocities in a flume tank, and saltwater in an offshore engineering basin.</p>
<h4 id="project-introduction">Project Introduction</h4>
<p>I am a part of the Mechanical team and am working on the electronics enclosure of the vehicle. This includes a carrier plate and a lid, that together, should be waterproof and handle water pressure at approximately 7.5 meters deep.</p>
<p>The lid prevents electronics from contacting water and has all the team members names embossed onto it.</p>
<p>The plate has scaffolding to hold the electronic stack and holes for binders.</p>

<h4 id="carrier-plate">Carrier Plate</h4>
<p>The carrier plate will be Anodized Aluminum with through holes to screw the lid onto it. It also has a slot for an o-ring.</p>
<h4 id="enclosure-lid">Enclosure Lid</h4>
<p>The lid will be resin printed out of Formlabs Clear Resin V5. This year, we decided to switch the material from Aluminum (like the plate), and so I have been spending most of my time working on this. This change was made because it will make it more lightweight, aesthetic and make it easier to monitor leaks.</p>
<p>Previous years also had the enclosure in a more box-like shape, but now I am still experimenting with different shapes to make it more hydrodynamic for the rougher conditions.</p>
